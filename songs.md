- O, let me walk with thee
- As water to the thirsty
- NÃ¥detime
- Nearer Still Nearer
- As we sail to heaven's shore
- I Will Bring You Home
- Joy in the journey
- He who began a good work in you
- A Chasing of the wind
- Oh, I want to know you more
- Find us faithful
- Let us run

Alle mine dager

- Herren er min hyrde
- Ditt barn vil du alltid bevare
- Jeg Har Funnet Ly?
