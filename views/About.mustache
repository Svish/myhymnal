
<h1>About</h1>

<p>I take singing lessons and I need something to sing at those lessons.
	Since I'm horrible at learning lyrics by heart and my song teacher need chords to play, we tended to search for chords on the web. Sometimes we didn't find it at all, sometimes only the lyrics, and sometimes they were just wrong or badly typed in. Existing lyrics and chord websites also usually look horrible and are often so full of ads that you can hardly see the lyrics.

<p>Since I also wanted to check out some PHP stuff and experiment with some things, I therefore decided to start on this website so me and my song teacher could have one single consistent place to go to.

<p>This is first and foremost meant as a personal website to make the lives of my song teacher and myself easier, but if it can be helpful to others that is great too.



<h2>Main goals</h2>

<ul>
	<li>All lyrics must be correct
	<li>All lyrics must have correct chords (correctly placed and through all verses)
	<li>The chords and lyrics should be easy to see from a distance
	<li>The chords and lyrics should fill as much of the screen as possible to minimize need for scrolling
	<li>Chords should be transposable
	<li>Songs should be easy to find and search for
	<li>Songs should have a good, solid, Christian message
</ul>

<p>The last point relates to me being a Christian myself and if I going to spend an hour every week singing, practicing, trying to internalise the words and express them with passion... well, then I want those words to be good and uplifting words. Words that really should be in my head. Words that are not meaningless, not about heart-break, affairs, cheap love or other depressive things that sucks in this world and that so many songs are about these ways.

<p>I think I have nailed most of these, but <a href="https://github.com/Svish/myhymnal/issues">let me know</a> if something is incorrect or could be better.



<h2>Future</h2>

<p>The site is currently tiny and will probably stay that way for a while. I am thinking about dumping in a lot more songs though, and if I start to add songs I do not necessarily want to sing myself then I have thought about maybe creating a feature where you can create your own collection of favorites. Your hymnal.



<h2>For curious developers</h2>

<p>If you would like to see the source code of this site you will always find the live version at <a href="https://github.com/Svish/myhymnal">github.com/Svish/myhymnal</a>. If you do have a look and find something horrible (which you probably will if you do) or if you just have suggestions for improvements or new features, let me know through the <a href="https://github.com/Svish/myhymnal/issues">issue tracker</a>.
